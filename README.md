A log of everything I ate and coffee I drank during my Tokyo 2019 trip 🍡☕🍛

* [Week 1](#day-05)

## Day 0.5

### Shinjuku sanchome nikuzushi (新宿三丁目 肉寿司)

Great first dinner. This small joint literally translates to "meat sushi"—as expected, we had horse sashimi (aka **basashi**), as well as raw chicken! I enjoyed the many ways they prepared basashi: nigiri, sashimi, negitoro, marinated, etc. I also recommend the cured egg yolks.

| Brunch at this famous fluffy pancake chain! I tried the berry pancakes. Definitely good, but was more dense than I expected. | ![flippers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13490001/55678655-57aeb080-58b2-11e9-84d7-c0fa95c730b5.jpg) |

| 🌟 Really great yakitori place, one of my favorite meals. They have an English menu, but ordering may be difficult if you're uncomfortable speaking Japanese. 💸 Cash only! | ![morimoto](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13490001/55678687-dd326080-58b2-11e9-8af2-16245b8b63c3.jpg) |

| ℹ️ | 📷 |

| 🌟 Within my top two coffee shops we visited, for sure. Had a chiller vibe amongst the third-wave coffee shops we tried. I was able to try every single bean they had on rotation during the first week 😄 | ![counterpart coffee gallery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13490001/55678686-dd326080-58b2-11e9-9b5e-07db069333ce.jpg) |

We tried both the monja and okonomiyaki. It was okay, but that's probably because I prefer Hiroshima style.

### nana's green tea
* 📍 Shinjuku
* 🍰 Sweets
* 🚀 [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/qS5shmfhSvN2) / [Website](http://www.nanasgreentea.com/)

| 🌟 Super yummy dessert shop with a variety of sweets, from traditional zenzai to modern parfaits. I got the black sesame anmitsu. We had to wait a bit, but definitely worth it. | ![nanas green tea](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13490001/55678774-0e5f6080-58b4-11e9-9da7-51b98a6447f5.jpg) |

| ℹ️ | 📷 |

| There was quite a line when we went—seems to be a popular spot. Noodles were nice and bouncy, but not sure if it was worth the wait! | ![udon shin](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13490001/55678812-de648d00-58b4-11e9-89d6-f66222302e26.jpg) |

| Breading was good, pork was juicy, but a little too fatty for my tastes. Dinner set also came with tonjiru and pickles. | ![tonkatsu aoki](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13490001/55678811-de648d00-58b4-11e9-9161-bef536829f5c.jpg) |

| Well-known shop. We did a pourover tasting with a Kenya and two Ethiopia beans. Bold and clear flavors, I distinctly remember the tomato taste. Super third wave-y. | ![2019-03-15 01 36 31 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13490001/55678888-16b89b00-58b6-11e9-8113-a02dfc52d1ee.jpg) |

| Our first izakaya of the trip, guided by a local friend. Really lovely, seasonal dishes. I enjoyed their take on izakaya classics, like this potato salad with cornhash beef and a soft-boiled egg. | ![minami no kaeru](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13490001/55678926-ef160280-58b6-11e9-8aaa-e733fa0a26d5.jpg) |

## Day 5

Counterpart Coffee again :coffee:

### Afuri

| ℹ️ | 📷 |
| --- | --- |
| First time trying the famous Afuri chain! I'm personally a fan of _assari_ (light) broths, so I really enjoyed the yuzu tsukemen. Others in my group who like _kotteri_ (rich) broths weren't as impressed. | ![IMG_20190315_122621](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13490001/55678964-998e2580-58b7-11e9-9427-db4b312abb9e.jpg) |

### DOWNSTAIRS COFFEE

* 🚀 [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/zPq6nV5mcKP2) / [Website](https://www.transit-web.com/content/shops/downstairs-coffee/downstairs/) / [Tabelog](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1307/A130701/13129689/)

This shop is owned by Mercedes Benz and has a large downstairs seating area. It was super packed when we went, and the soy latte was alright.

### Kintan (六本木焼肉Kintan)
* 📍 Roppongi
* 🍽 Yakiniku
* 🚀 [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/EHJVPHSEamM2) / [Tabelog](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1307/A130701/13166084/)

This yakiniku joint had a more upscale vibe than what I'm used to, but still decently priced. The gyutan was great, and the nicer meats were 🔥

### 1967
* 📍 Roppongi
* 🍷 Fancy lounge
* 🚀 [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/RAHhnpCUfXB2) / [Website](http://www.bagus-99.com/1967/) / [Tabelog](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1307/A130701/13153619/)

Lots of buzz about this place! Really great espresso in the gibraltor I got. I even braved dairy milk (I'm lactose intolerant) and it was worth it. No photos allowed inside the shop.

### Ojaga (おじゃが)
* 📍 Shimokitazawa
* 🍽 Potato dishes
* 🚀 [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/D78N6Jn8hYv) / [Website](https://shimokita-ojaga.com/71589/) / [Tabelog](https://tabelog.com/en/tokyo/A1318/A131802/13049309/)

As the name would suggest, this place had a lot of potato specials. We got the nikujaga lunch set, which was simple and home-y.

### Shimokita Chaen Oyama (しもきた茶苑大山)
* 📍 Shimokitazawa
* 🍰 Shaved ice + sweets
* 🚀 [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/YE81pXM4BDP2) / [Website](https://shimokita-chaen.com/) / [Tabelog](https://tabelog.com/tokyo/A1318/A131802/13025597/)

🌟 This was my favorite dessert place 😭 We got the matcha shaved ice with shirotama + kinako, and zenzai with fried mochi and frothy matcha to pour on top.

Tabelog and Google Maps translate the shop name differently 🤷‍ Either way, the soba was delicious!!! I was too busy catching up with friends that I didn't take any photos 😅

### WOMB
* 📍 Shibuya
* 💃 Club
* 🚀 [Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/iQcR6DR19FJ2) / [Website](http://www.womb.co.jp/)

The one club we went to 😂 Drinks were whatever, people were respectful, and they played tropical and deep house all night.
